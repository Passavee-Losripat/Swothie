# Swothie
**Swothie** is an educational game created for the Swift Student Challenge 2024, designed to help players master the essential skill of conducting a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) in a fun and interactive way.

## ðŸ“– Project Description
Swothie leverages **SwiftUI** and **SpriteKit** to deliver an engaging learning experience. With a modern design and smooth gameplay mechanics, it provides a platform to practice strategic thinking through real-world example through the game.
To enhance performance and ensure a smooth user experience, the game also implements **sprite caching** for optimized rendering.

## ðŸš€ How to run the project

2. Extract the contents of the zip file.
3. Open the extracted project in the Playgrounds application.
4. Click the Run button to start the game and begin your journey in SWOT analysis!


## ðŸŒŸ What I have learnt through this project
Swothie is my first application developed using the Swift programming language. During my development journey, I have gained hands-on experience with:

* **SwiftUI**: For designing intuitive and responsive user interfaces.
* **SpriteKit**: For creating interactive animations and game mechanics.
* **Sprite Caching**: To enhance performance by reducing redundant rendering processes in the game.

This project has been a rewarding introduction to iOS app development and has inspired me to combine my coding skills with my business management knowledge in future projects.
